            Mason "Dipper" Pines is a fictional character and one of the two lead
        characters in the Disney Channel animated series Gravity Falls. The
        character is voiced by Jason Ritter, and is loosely based on the childhood
        of series creator Alex Hirsch. Dipper is the only character to appear
        in all the episodes of Gravity Falls. Beside his presence in the main
        series, he appears in the Gravity Falls mini-series titled "Dipper's Guide
        to the Unexplained" and the shorts "Fixin' it with Soos" and "Mabel's
        Guide to Life".<br><br>
        
            Two alternate reality versions of Dipper are featured in Rick and Morty
        media and Gravity Falls: Lost Legends: Mortipper Pinesâ€“Smith, a composite
        character of Dipper and Morty Smith, and Mabipper Pines, a combined
        version of Dipper and his sister Mabel, with the former character
        featuring in the Rick and Morty episodes "Close Rick-counters of the Rick
        Kind" and "The Ricklantis Mixup", and as a playable character in the video
        game Pocket Mortys.
